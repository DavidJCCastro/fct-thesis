\section{Protein Purification}

In order to better understand the goal of this project, we must first understand how protein purification works. Protein purification is the process of isolating a specific protein of interest from a complex biological mixture, such as a cell lysate or a tissue sample. The objective is to remove all non-protein contaminants and other undesirable proteins while maintaining the biological activity and structural integrity of the target molecule.

The primary challenge in this field lies in the immense diversity of proteins. Every protein possesses a unique combination of physico-chemical properties, including molecular weight, net charge, surface hydrophobicity, and specific binding affinities. Because these characteristics vary significantly even between similar proteins, there is no universal "one-size-fits-all" protocol. For proteins that do not yet have an established protocol, researchers must rely on a labor-intensive "trial and error" approach. This involves testing various experimental conditions and chemical buffers, which is both time-consuming and resource-heavy, often becoming a bottleneck in biochemical research.

To achieve high levels of purity, laboratory workflows rely almost exclusively on liquid chromatography. Chromatography techniques function by passing a mobile phase containing the protein mixture through a stationary phase. The components of the mixture are separated based on how they interact with the stationary phase:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Affinity:} Based on specific biological interactions between the protein and a ligand.
  \item \textbf{Size Exclusion:} Based on the physical dimensions and shape of the molecule.
  \item \textbf{Ion Exchange:} Based on the net surface charge of the protein. 
  \item \textbf{Hydrophobic Interaction:} Based on the distribution of non-polar groups on the protein surface.
\end{itemize}

In practice, a single step is rarely sufficient. A complete purification protocol is a chronological sequence of these techniques, organized to progressively refine the sample. These multi-step sequences form the purification protocols that this project aims to be able to predict.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Despite more than a century of methodological advances, protein purification remains a major bottleneck in both basic research and industrial biotechnology. While expression systems and analytical techniques have become increasingly standardized, the design of purification protocols (particularly for non-tagged proteins) continues to rely heavily on empirical optimization. In practice, this often involves iterative testing of chromatography media, buffer compositions, and elution conditions, guided primarily by expert intuition and prior experience rather than formalized predictive principles.

This trial-and-error paradigm has several limitations. It is time-consuming, costly in terms of reagents and labor, and poorly scalable when applied to large numbers of proteins, such as those emerging from modern genomics and structural biology initiatives, like \textit{AlphaFold}, a deep learning model that predicts protein structures.

Recent advances in machine learning, particularly sequence-based modeling and natural language processing, provide an opportunity to address this gap. Large public repositories such as the Protein Data Bank implicitly encode decades of successful purification efforts, while biomedical literature contains detailed experimental protocols that are now accessible in machine-readable form. We hope that by leveraging these resources we can accelerate the discovery of protein purification protocols using deep learning tools and techniques.

\section{Goal}
\label{sec:goal}

The primary goal of this dissertation is to develop a computational system capable of predicting protein purification protocols directly from protein sequence data and derived physico-chemical properties into an ordered, laboratory-ready purification recipe composed of chromatography steps and associated techniques, reflecting strategies that have been validated in prior experimental work.

To achieve this, the project aims to integrate large-scale data mining from structural databases and the biomedical literature with a Transformer-based model architecture designed for sequential purification protocol prediction. The expected output is not a single optimized protocol, but a plausible and informative starting strategy that can guide experimental design and reduce the search space explored during laboratory optimization.
