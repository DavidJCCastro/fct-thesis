\ntindex[Historical context]{}

The history of protein purification is intrinsically linked to our understanding of life at the molecular level. This journey began in 1789 when Antoine Fourcroy first distinguished several types of complex organic substances, which he categorized as "albumins," including fibrin, gelatin, and gluten. Although these substances were not yet recognized as proteins, their consistent presence in biological processes made them a primary focus for early chemists. The identification of the building blocks of these substances was a slow process; while asparagine was the first amino acid isolated in 1809, its role as a fundamental constituent of proteins was not fully established until 1873. A critical link was formed earlier, in 1819, with the isolation of leucine, which helped researchers begin to understand the chemical nature of these "albuminous" materials.

By 1837, Gerrit J. Mulder determined the elemental composition of several proteins and proposed that they shared a common core substance. In response to these findings, Jacob Berzelius suggested the name "protein" in 1838, derived from the Greek word \textit{proteios}, meaning "primary" or "of the first rank." Despite this naming, the chemical diversity of proteins remained largely unknown; at the time, only glycine and leucine had been identified. It would take nearly another century, until the discovery of threonine in 1936, for the complete set of 20 standard amino acids to be recognized.

A defining moment in the field occurred in 1926, amidst a heated debate over whether enzymes were distinct chemical entities or simply "catalytic forces" associated with proteins. James Sumner settled this by isolating and crystallizing the enzyme urease from jack beans. This achievement provided the first definitive proof that enzymes were proteins with specific, defined chemical structures that could be purified to homogeneity. Sumner's work, which earned him the Nobel Prize in 1946, effectively birthed the field of structural biochemistry and established purification as a prerequisite for understanding protein function.

In the decades following Sumner's breakthrough, the field saw the development of diverse biophysical techniques designed to separate proteins based on their intrinsic properties, such as electrical charge, molecular size, and polarity. These methods—including various forms of chromatography and electrophoresis—became the standard toolkit for biochemists. The landscape of protein science changed again in 1973, when Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer developed recombinant DNA technology. This allowed scientists to insert specific DNA sequences into host organisms like \textit{E. coli}, turning bacteria into "factories" for the mass production of specific proteins.

While recombinant technology solved the problem of protein "sourcing," it introduced new challenges for purification. In the 1980s, the development of affinity tags (such as the polyhistidine tag or GST-tag) revolutionized the field by allowing researchers to add a universal "handle" to any recombinant protein. This made purification significantly easier and more predictable. However, these tags can often interfere with the protein's native folding, biological activity, or its suitability for therapeutic use in humans. 

Consequently, the purification of "non-tagged" proteins remains the gold standard for many high-precision applications. Because every non-tagged protein has a unique combination of surface charges and hydrophobic patches, designing an effective purification protocol remains a labor-intensive process of trial and error. This historical difficulty is the primary driver for the current research, as we seek to automate the design of these complex protocols through computational modeling. We have not yet discarded the possiblity of increasing the scope of our project to include tagged proteins, however it is currently hung up on analysis of our preliminary results.
